Tests run on my dynamic array:

push_back function:
	Tried to create two the reallocating functions of the dynamic array when size limit is 	exceeded
	First one was using mallocs, and malloc bigger sized memory, then copies current memory into this bigger memory and continue pushing elements in the array 
	Second one was doing the same thing but I only used realloc
	
	Tests using chrono library and compiling with g++ with no -O:
	 
	Pushed elements: 1'000'000'000
	
	Malloc:
		Elapsed time in microseconds: 14052 milliseconds
		
	Realloc:
		Elapsed time in microseconds: 23104 milliseconds
		
	
	Pushed elements: 100'000'000
	
	Malloc:
		Elapsed time in microseconds: 1122 milliseconds
		
	Realloc:
		Elapsed time in microseconds: 801 milliseconds
		
	std::vector:
		Elapsed time in microseconds: 1349 milliseconds

	
	Pushed elements: 10'000'000
	
	Malloc:
		Elapsed time in microseconds: 105 milliseconds
		
	Realloc:
		Elapsed time in microseconds: 67 milliseconds
		
	std::vector:
		Elapsed time in microseconds: 139 milliseconds
